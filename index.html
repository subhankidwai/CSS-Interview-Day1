    <h3>Q.No.1 - Difference between flex row and column.</h3>
    <p>Ans - Default value. The flexible items are displayed horizontally, as a row while flex column displays item vertically as columns.</p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.2 - Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet.</h3>
    <p>Inline styling gets applied directly to the element in the style attribute. This styling
    is having the highest priority among all. But it is not advised to use this styling
    much in projects.</p>
    <p>Internal styling gets written in the head tag of the HTML file. It will be written in
    the style tag. The styling written in style tag will be applicable only in that HTML
    file.</p>
    <p>External Styling is done by creating a different CSS file with .css extension. This
    file can be linked to any HTML file wherever the styling is required. The external
    CSS file can be attached to the HTML file in the head tag in the link tag. This
    styling is having the least priority but it is the most advised way of writing styling
    in projects.</p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.3 - Justify-content allows you to do what?</h3>
    <p>The justify-content property specifies how flex-items are distributed along the
    main axis of their parent flex-container. If the flex-direction of the parent container
    is row(default value) then the main axis will be the x-axis. If the flex-direction is a
    column then the main axis will be the y-axis. This property has 6 different possible
    values: <ul>
        <li>flex-start(default)</li>
        <li>flex-end</li>
        <li>center</li>
        <li>space-around</li>
        <li>space-between</li>
        <li>space-evenly</li>
        <li>stretch</li>
    </ul></p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.4 - Difference between absolute and relative positioning</h3>
    <p>position-relative:- 
        <ul>
            <li>It is used when we need to position the HTML element relative to its normal
            position.</li>
            <li>We can set top, right, bottom and left properties that will cause the element to adjust away from the normal position.</li>
        </ul>
        position-absolute:- 
        <ul>
            <li>An element with position absolute will move according to the position of its
            parent element.</li>
            <li>In the absence of the parent element, the HTML element will be placed
            according to the body tag. In this case if you want to place the element at
            any position based on the parent element then we need to give the position :
            relative to parent element and then position : absolute to child element.</li>
        </ul>
    </p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.5 - What is grid-template-columns used for?</h3>
    <p>Grid-template-columns property defines how many columns should be there in a
    grid-container. The number of columns is determined by the number of values
    defined in the space-separated list. It takes values in px, % and fraction (fr).</p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.6 - What is the z-index in CSS?</h3>
    <p>The z-index property determines the stack level of an HTML element. The “stack
    level” refers to the element’s position on the Z axis (as opposed to the X axis or Y
    axis). Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower
    index. If the z-index value of any element is positive then that element will be at
    the top and element having negative value of z-index will be at the bottom.</p><br>
    <h3>Q.No.7 - What is the difference between padding and margin?</h3>
    <p>Margin - 
        <ul>
            <li>Margin provides the space
                between the border and nearby
                elements. It is the space outside
                the border.</li>
            <li>You can set margin values to be
                negative if you want elements to
                overlap.</li>
            <li>When you set margin values, the
                element's size does not change,
                only the space around it.</li>
        </ul>
        Padding - 
        <ul>
            <li>Padding provides the space
                between the border and the
                content of an element. It is the space inside the border </li>
            <li>Padding values can only be
                positive.</li>
            <li>When you set padding values, the size of that element increases.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
